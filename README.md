Customer Segmentation using K-Means Method
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on key features such as annual income and spending behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses better understand customer patterns, target marketing strategies, and improve decision-making. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, and the results are visualized for clear interpretation.
